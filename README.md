This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Perl: the unpredictable iteration order of hashes. The `bug.pl` file shows code that seems to iterate through a hash in a specific order, but this behavior is not guaranteed and can lead to unexpected results in different Perl versions or environments. The `bugSolution.pl` file offers a solution using a sorted key list to ensure consistent iteration order.
